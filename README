# AWS CREDENTIALS
#   Avoid to hardcode AWS credentials, instead use environment variables.
#   Terraform will be able to pick it up: 

#     export AWS_ENV_NAME=xxxxxxxx

#     Locally set secret and access key to connect with AWS. Set AWS CLI for these credentials. 

# #VARIABLES

# - Copy terraform.tfvars vars names an create new file, name it as terraform-dev.tfvars,
#    and set your own local values.  

#     Terraform will search by default into "terraform.tfvar" file first. 
#     To use a specific  .tfvars file use the follos command with "apply" -var-file [file-name-env].tfvars
#     example: "terraform apply -var-file terraform-dev.tfvars"

#     Create a terraform-dev.tfvar file to set the neccesary variables, e.g. 

# #ENVIRONMENTS PREFIX
#     - app-name-dev
#     - app-name-staging
#     - app-name-prod


# #REMBER SOME TERRAFORM USEFUL COMMANDS
#     -auto-approve: avoid approving, typing yes
#     -apply: apply changes to a current state
#     plan: get a preview of the changes


#DO NOT PUSH terraform.tfvars file with your values, keep empty
# only use as refrence to create another file witjh same variables name.
